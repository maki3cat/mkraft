### Basic Raft Properties and Mechanisms that guarantee them
Raft guarantees that each of these properties is true at all the time
#### Leader Election ($5.2)-> DONE
- Election Safety: at most one leader can be elected in a given term (not time but term) -> ($5.2 Leader Election)
#### Log Replication ($5.3)-> DONE
- Leader Append-only: a leader never overwrites or deletes entries in its logs; it only appends new entries; -> ($5.3 Log Replication)
(but followers may overwrite or truncate their logs)
- Log Matching: if two logs contain an entry with the same index and term, then logs are identical in all entries up through the given index; -> ($5.3 Log Replication)
#### Safety ($5.4)->DONE
- Leader Completeness: if a log entry is commited in a given term, then that entry will be present in the logs of the leaders for all higher numbered terms; ($5.4)
- State Machine Safety: if a server has applied a log entry at a given index to its state machine, no other server will ever apply a different log entry for the same index ($5.4.3)
#### Testing of the Cluster
#### Automatic Deployment of the Cluster


### From Lab to Industry

#### Dynamic Membership
#### Log Compaction
#### An implementation of The StateMachine

## Patterns for GoGymnastics
- [ ] async all with future pattern
- [ ] retry call with timeout
- [ ] fan-in/fan-out in RAFT
- [ ] short stopping in RAFT
- [ ] ticker, timer
- [ ] context examples summary
- [ ] plummer and channels

## Implementation Decisions and Extreme Engineering
- [ ] add batching to handling ClientCommands, and send AppendLogEntries
- [ ] check prof Yang's improvements of paxos for ideas
- [ ] check architecture classes of caching and memory hierarchy for ideas
